Here are some proposed improvements and refactoring ideas for your codebase, organized by priority:

### High Priority
• Improve Folder Structure and Modularity  
  - Reason: The frontend directory has many files. Grouping related components, hooks, and utilities into dedicated subfolders will make the code easier to navigate and maintain.  
  - Action: Move each group of related files (e.g., hooks, UI elements, evals, history, etc.) into their own clearly labeled folders. Consolidate or rename any duplicates.

• Add Consistent Error Handling  
  - Reason: Multiple components and utilities might throw or handle errors differently. Inconsistent patterns can lead to missing error cases or unclear user feedback.  
  - Action: Create a global error handler or define a standard pattern for catching and displaying errors, especially in asynchronous operations.

• Improve TypeScript Strictness  
  - Reason: Some files might be missing robust type definitions. Stricter TypeScript settings (such as "strictNullChecks") reduce bugs and clarify developer intention.  
  - Action: Enforce stricter compiler options in tsconfig.json (for example, strict, noImplicitAny, etc.) and address any resulting type errors.

### Medium Priority
• Consolidate Common Utility Functions  
  - Reason: Utility functions like “capitalize”, “takeScreenshot”, and “cn” are decentralized. Overly scattered utilities create confusion and duplication.  
  - Action: Create a single “utils” folder (or refine the existing one) that neatly organizes them. Export them from an index file for easy imports.

• Extract Reusable Layout Components  
  - Reason: The primary layout (e.g., header, footer, sidebars) might be defined across several files. Centralizing them improves manageability and keeps business logic separate from layout.  
  - Action: Refactor repeated layout elements into dedicated layout or wrapper components that can be used across different pages.

• Introduce or Enhance Linting and Formatting Rules  
  - Reason: Code style and consistency can vary across files. Automated linting and formatting reduce code review friction and keep the repository clean.  
  - Action: Update .eslintrc.cjs or add rules in an ESLint config to standardize code style (spaces vs. tabs, trailing commas, etc.). Use Prettier or a similar tool to unify formatting.

### Low Priority
• Improve Comments and Documentation  
  - Reason: Despite the descriptive file names, newer developers or contributors might struggle to grasp certain functionalities quickly.  
  - Action: Add doc comments to crucial utility functions and components. Briefly explain their purpose, expected parameters, and possible return values.

• Optimize for Performance Where Relevant  
  - Reason: Not all parts of the app may require optimization. However, there may be some expensive operations (e.g., large or repeated re-renders).  
  - Action: Identify high-traffic paths or CPU-intensive processes. Apply memoization in React hooks or use React Profiler to see where lazy loading or code splitting might help.

• Enhance Testing Coverage  
  - Reason: While you have a few tests, ensuring broader coverage improves robustness.  
  - Action: Write more tests covering edge cases in critical components (e.g., generation logic, history management). Use a standard test naming scheme and add integration tests if possible.

These adjustments will help keep your codebase more organized, scalable, and contributor-friendly.
