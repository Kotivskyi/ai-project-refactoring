YO! After reviewing the codebase, here are the suggested improvements organized by priority:

### High Priority

- **Standardize Error Handling** 
  - Why: Currently error handling is inconsistent across different modules, making debugging and maintenance harder
  - What: Create a custom error handling module with standardized error types and handlers for common scenarios (API errors, validation errors, etc.)
  - Implementation: Create new `errors.py` module with custom exception classes and handlers

- **Improve Type Safety**
  - Why: Some type hints are missing or using Any, which reduces type safety benefits
  - What: Add missing type hints and replace Any with more specific types where possible
  - Implementation: Focus on routes and core modules first

- **Extract Configuration Management**
  - Why: Configuration is scattered across multiple files and mixed with code
  - What: Create a centralized configuration management system
  - Implementation: Create a new `config` module using Pydantic settings management

### Medium Priority

- **Implement Proper Logging System**
  - Why: Current logging is mainly print statements which isn't suitable for production
  - What: Replace print statements with proper structured logging
  - Implementation: Use Python's logging module with proper log levels and formatters

- **Modularize Prompt Management**
  - Why: Prompt management is currently rigid and hard to maintain
  - What: Create a more flexible prompt management system
  - Implementation: Create a prompt registry system with versioning and A/B testing capabilities

- **Improve Test Coverage**
  - Why: Testing seems limited, making refactoring risky
  - What: Add more unit tests and integration tests
  - Implementation: Start with core business logic in prompts and code generation

### Low Priority

- **API Documentation**
  - Why: API endpoints lack proper documentation
  - What: Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - Implementation: Add proper docstrings and FastAPI documentation decorators

- **Code Generation Pipeline Abstraction**
  - Why: Code generation logic is tightly coupled
  - What: Create a more modular pipeline system for code generation
  - Implementation: Create a pipeline system that allows easy addition of new generation steps

- **Websocket Connection Management**
  - Why: Websocket handling could be more robust
  - What: Improve connection handling, reconnection logic, and error recovery
  - Implementation: Create a WebSocket manager class with proper connection lifecycle handling

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific implementation details for any particular improvement?
